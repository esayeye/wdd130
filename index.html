        <p>Hello, My name is Sunday from Lagos,Nigeria. I am a chemical Engineering graduate with
            great desire to venture into the tech world. My hobby is football and solving analytical
            problems. I am really excited to be learning Web Development here through BYU and I
            intend to make maximum use of this opportunity to gain as much tech skills as possible
            and to apply it in
            helping my community as well as creating a future source of income for myself. You are
            welcome
            to journey with me through this amazing chapter. Much love ❤️ </p>
