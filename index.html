            <p>Hello, My name is Sunday Emmanuel Ayeye from Lagos,Nigeria. I am a chemical Engineering
                graduate with
                great desire to venture into the tech world. My hobby is football and solving analytical
                problems. I am really excited to be learning Web Development here through BYU and I
                intend to make maximum use of this opportunity to gain as much tech skills as possible
                and to apply it in
                helping my community as well as creating a future source of income for myself. You are
                welcome
                to journey with me through this amazing chapter. Much love ❤️ </p>
